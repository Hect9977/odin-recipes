    <h3>Breakfast is the most important meal of the day! What other way to start your day with some fluffy french toast!</h3>
    <p>This is the best French toast recipe. It's different because it uses flour. I have given it to some friends and they've all liked it better than the French toast they usually make!</p>
    <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong>Wednesday is Nov. 28, and also French Toast Day on the calendar. French toast is also known as <strong>“German toast,” “eggy bread,” “gypsy toast” and “Poor Knights of Windsor.”</strong> Bread and eggs are the primary ingredients, and staler bread is preferred because it better absorbs the eggs before the mixture is fried.</p>
